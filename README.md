## MERN Crash Course
A comprehensive crash course on building a full-stack application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a MERN Product Store, covering the basics of building a full-stack application from scratch. The course covers:

## Setting up a MongoDB database
1. Creating a RESTful API using Express and Node.js
2. Building a React frontend application
3. Integrating the frontend and backend using API calls

## Getting Started
# Prerequisites
1. Node.js (version 14 or higher)
2. MongoDB (version 4 or higher)
3. npm (version 6 or higher)

# Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone [https://github.com/burakorkmez/mern-crash-course.git](https://github.com/burakorkmez/mern-crash-course.git`)
2. Install dependencies: npm install
3. Start the development server: npm start
4. Directory Structure
5. backend: Contains the Express API code
6. frontend: Contains the React application code
7. models: Contains the MongoDB schema definitions
8. routes: Contains the API route handlers

## Usage
# Running the Application
1. Start the MongoDB server: mongod
2. Start the Express API server: npm start (in the backend directory)
3. Start the React development server: npm start (in the frontend directory)

## API Endpoints
1. GET /api/users: Retrieves a list of all users
2. POST /api/users: Creates a new user
3. GET /api/users/:id: Retrieves a single user by ID
4. PUT /api/users/:id: Updates a single user by ID
5. DELETE /api/users/:id: Deletes a single user by ID
